Human cardiac organoids hold remarkable potential for cardiovascular disease modeling and human pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocyte (hPSC-CM) transplantation. Here, we show cardiac organoids engineered with electrically conductive silicon nanowires (e-SiNWs) significantly enhance the therapeutic efficacy of hPSC-CMs to treat infarcted hearts. We first demonstrated the biocompatibility of e-SiNWs and their capacity to improve cardiac microtissue engraftment in healthy rat myocardium. Nanowired human cardiac organoids were then engineered with hPSC-CMs, nonmyocyte supporting cells, and e-SiNWs. Nonmyocyte supporting cells promoted greater ischemia tolerance of cardiac organoids, and e-SiNWs significantly improved electrical pacing capacity. After transplantation into ischemia/reperfusion–injured rat hearts, nanowired cardiac organoids significantly improved contractile development of engrafted hPSC-CMs, induced potent cardiac functional recovery, and reduced maladaptive left ventricular remodeling. Compared to contemporary studies with an identical injury model, greater functional recovery was achieved with a 20-fold lower dose of hPSC-CMs, revealing therapeutic synergy between conductive nanomaterials and human cardiac organoids for efficient heart repair.

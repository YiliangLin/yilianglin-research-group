Zirui joined Dr. Lin’s lab as a MSc student in Fall 2024. He graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in Architectural Environment Engineering from the University of Nottingham in 2024. During the undergraduate studies, he focused on the design and numerical simulation of photovoltaic thermal systems with nanofluids and phase change materials. Zirui’s current research mainly centered on engineered conductive bacterial biofilms for enhanced energy conversion and storage.

summary: >-
  Stretchable conductors maintain electrical conductivity at large strains
  relative to their rigid counterparts

  that fail at much lower strains. Here, we demonstrate ultrastretchable conductors that are conductive to

  at least 600% strain and may be strain-cycled without significant degradation to the mechanical or

  electrical properties. The conductors consist of a liquid metal alloy injected into microchannels composed

  of triblock copolymer gels. Rheological measurements identify the temperature window over which

  these gels may be molded and laminated to form microchannels without collapsing the microscale

  features. Mechanical measurements identify the gel composition that represents a compromise between

  minimizing modulus (to allow the polymer to be stretched with ease) and maximizing interfacial

  adhesion strength at the laminated polymerâ€“polymer interface. The resulting 2D stretchable conductors

  are notable for their ability to maintain electrical conductivity up to large strains, their mechanical

  durability, and their ability to be recycled easily with full recovery of the component species

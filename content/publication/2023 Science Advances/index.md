  Semiconductor-based biointerfaces are typically established either on the surface of the plasma membrane or within the cytoplasm. In Gram-negative bacteria, the periplasmic space, characterized by its confinement and the presence of numerous enzymes and peptidoglycans, offers additional opportunities for biomineralization, allowing for nongenetic modulation interfaces. We demonstrate semiconductor nanocluster precipitation containing single- and multiple-metal elements within the periplasm, as observed through various electron- and x-ray-based imaging techniques. The periplasmic semiconductors are metastable and display defect-dominant fluorescent properties. Unexpectedly, the defect-rich (i.e., the low-grade) semiconductor nanoclusters produced in situ can still increase adenosine triphosphate levels and malate production when coupled with photosensitization. We expand the sustainability levels of the biohybrid system to include reducing heavy metals at the primary level, building living bioreactors at the secondary level, and creating semi-artificial photosynthesis at the tertiary level. The biomineralization-enabled periplasmic biohybrids have the potential to serve as defect-tolerant platforms for diverse sustainable applications.

summary:  >-
  In this work, we show that the periplasm, an underappreciated subcellular region in materials research, can offer a nongenetic pathway for biomineralization of metastable semiconductor nanoclusters. Under light stimulation, the metastable semiconductor nanoclusters could couple with the electron transport chain to increase ATP levels and enhance malate production in the living hybrids. The current demonstration of semiconductor-based biointerfaces in the periplasm and the use of hybrid living materials provide a valuable path toward programmable and adaptable systems where existing cellular chassis and a wide range of nanocluster-cell combinations can be used. Using the E. coli strain as a model, the current system to develop periplasmic biointerface for enhanced solar-to-chemical production might be extended to other bacterial cells to potentially endow additional sustainability level to the bioremediation applications

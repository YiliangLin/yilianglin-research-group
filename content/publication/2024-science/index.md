Flexible integration spurs diverse applications in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). However, current configurations suffer from the trade-off between MOF loadings and mechanical compliance. We report a wrinkled configuration of MOF thin films. We established an interfacial synthesis confined and controlled by a polymer topcoat and achieved multiple Turing motifs in the wrinkled thin films. These films have complete MOF surface coverage and exhibit strain tolerance up to 53.2%. The enhanced mechanical properties allow film transfer onto various substrates. We obtained membranes with large H2/CO2 selectivity (41.2) and high H2 permeance (8.46 Ã— 103 gas permeation units), showcasing negligible defects after transfer. We also achieved soft humidity sensors on delicate electrodes by avoiding exposure to harsh MOF synthesis conditions. These results highlight the potential of wrinkled MOF thin films for plug-and-play integration.

summary:  >-
  We report a wrinkled configuration for MOF thin films. The deformable structures confer enhanced strain tolerance, and the wrinkles provide additional exposed surfaces compared with that of planar configurations. Unlike common methods to produce wrinkled structures in other inorganic materials, we developed a synthesis protocol that uses diffusion-driven instability to generate wrinkled MOF thin films that could be utilized for gas seperation and electronics with flexible MOF films.

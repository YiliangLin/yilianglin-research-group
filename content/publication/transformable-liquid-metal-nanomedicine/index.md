abstract: To date, numerous inorganic nanocarriers have been explored for drug
  delivery systems (DDSs). However, the clinical application of inorganic
  formulations has often been hindered by their toxicity and failure to
  biodegrade. We describe here a transformable liquid-metal nanomedicine, based
  on a core–shell nanosphere composed of a liquid-phase eutectic gallium-indium
  core and a thiolated polymeric shell. This formulation can be simply produced
  through a sonication-mediated method with bioconjugation flexibility. The
  resulting nanoparticles loaded with doxorubicin (Dox) have an average diameter
  of 107 nm and demonstrate the capability to fuse and subsequently degrade
  under a mildly acidic condition, which facilitates release of Dox in acidic
  endosomes after cellular internalization. Equipped with hyaluronic acid, a
  tumour-targeting ligand, this formulation displays enhanced chemotherapeutic
  inhibition towards the xenograft tumour-bearing mice. This liquid metal-based
  DDS with fusible and degradable behaviour under physiological conditions
  provides a new strategy for engineering theranostic agents with low toxicity.

summary: "We have developed a new liquid metal-based drug delivery platform for
  anticancer therapy. The liquid-metal nanomedicines are able to fuse for
  promoting drug release and eventually degrade under a mild acidic environment.
